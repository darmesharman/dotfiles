# My Dotfiles

This repository stores all my dot configurations (like .zshrc, .gitconfig etc.)
So it will be easy to set up my environment on a new machine.
After installing necessary software, just run ./install script

## Git

I use git as my version control system. Install git and run script.

## Kitty Terminal

I use kitty terminal as my default terminal emulator.

After installing kitty, you can run ./install script.

## Zsh

I use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as my zsh configuration manager.

First we need to install zsh and oh-my-zsh, and then run ./install script
